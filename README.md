Compare Spotify Playlists

This is a beginner's project that I did to utilize Python and the Spotify developer's API to compare Spotify Playlists. The purpose of the project is to understand Python at a beginner's level and do something a little interesting but not too complex.

Note: 
If there are no matching songs, the output will return as "Empty DataFrame" with Track and Artist as the variables.

How to Use:
After creating a Spotify developer account, place the correct information to the labeled section of the program.
